# CS1699-Final-Project

## Bilal Riaz, Hunsi Jay, and Bruno Arnabar

Our final project is about predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) for documented patients. We took an existing CVD model and enhanced the dataset to reduce gender biases. We ran data analytics on the new dataset, and trained models on 4 different types of classifiers to see which would perform the best. In addition, we added interpretability into our AI model by using a python package called SHAP that can provide an analysis about which features of the dataset provide the most influence into the model's prediction.
